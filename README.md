## Description

Employee Tracker is a console application for business owners that helps organize and keep track of their employees and departments. It utilizes `MySQL` to establish a relational database that can be queried via the application's options.

In creating this project, I learned a lot about connecting `Node.js` with `MySQL` to perform useful operations on a relational database via user input.

3. Once unzipped, ensure that MySQL is installed and hosting a live server

4. Open the `config` directory and edit lines 6-9 with your MySQL server information to ensure a proper connection.

5. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files in either DBeaver or via the command-line to initiate the database and seed it with initial data. (Running the seeds.sql file is optional, but may be useful if it contains all of the information you wish to include).

6. Run the following commands to install all dependencies and start the application

```
npm install

npm start
```
